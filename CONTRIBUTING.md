# The maker Passport

The idea of a maker passport is a proposed solution to different recurring issues in the maker community:
-What/who is a maker?
-How can one prove he is a maker?
-Is “maker” a profession, if not, how can it eventually become one?
-On what basis, can a maker then be trusted for hire or association on a sensible project?

A normal passport functions both as an identification document, but also keeps track of the mobility of the holder. We will be adding to those functionalities, a record of the skills possessed by the maker and the makerspaces, FabLab, events where they were acquired.

## How do I contribute?

Additions are always welcome, just [create an issue](https://github.com/openfab-lab/passeportMaker/issues) and propose something
Content can be created in any language, but use of English is strongly encouraged for maximum diffusion.

### On what I can help?

at this time, the passport is in quick&dirty mode, so... whithout order, it could help to work on:  
- [ ] a graphic charte with some level/guideline on how you can customize it to your community
- [ ] a template and a guide on "how to propose a new skill", better if already linked to openbadge.org
- [ ] understanding how to connect with openbadge.org
- [ ] a template page for collecting badges
- [ ] a template page for stamps from places, events, like the original hacker passport. (Visa pages)
- [ ] how to create a new page to add cheatsheets or anything
- [ ] maybe a guide to create a stamp 
- [ ] how to activate a machine, for ex. with RFID sticker. 
- [ ] how to create a database for users from a community or link with one already in use.
- [ ] maybe a link to do with [easylab](https://easylab.io/machines/#/product?_k=16u3v5)
- [ ] it need to be linked to a "code of conduct" so it will lead to thrust between communities and thrust between user inside these community.
- [ ] need (should) be linked to "how to use github" and a gamification. For exemple, [the gamification we are working on](https://github.com/openfab-lab/gamification-fablab)  
- [ ] a better manifesto, more specific, I don't know, the one I Use was just visualy nice but should be more specific.
- [ ] a better CONTRIBUTING.md ^^
- [ ] a planning on what we have to do with timeline. 
- [ ] a list of communties who use it, or want to. 
- [ ] others?
