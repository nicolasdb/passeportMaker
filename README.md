As a founder and fabmanager of the Fablab OpenFab in Brussels, Ixelles. 
I'm challenged everyday on subject like:
- how manage members of the labs and how to optimise the flow through tools and tutorials, from the beginning (subscribing) to the end of a project (realisation). 
- How to engage people into habits of documenting their progress and hlp them to share knowledge?
- How to propose a clear framework?

 

## At the beginning:
```
The passport was made to
* promote people visiting as many hackerspaces around the world
* increase collaboration
* increase cross-pollination so we can all learn from one another
* encourage all hackerspaces to support each other
(And it's fun)
```

It's been a while since I discovered the hackerspace passport but it was not enought for me.
It's fun to have stamp from communities and events but then... This not solve the problem we face everyday.

## So why not adding some extra page on it?
It could be use as:
* A pass to access occasionally other makerspaces and Fablabs without to pay an other membership. One PASS to rules them all [*Like Copass for coworking*](https://copass.org/)
* This is your maker ID 
* This could be your CV with:
	* List all the skills/badges
	* List all your WIP (WorkInProgress) and last projects
* Contain your best cheatsheets
* Could be a pocket lamp, yeah, why not a pcb cover with led.
* It grow with you
* And can embed RFID for advance connectivity
	* like Automatic activation of tools via log rfid
	* logging time spent on tools
	* check-in into makerspaces
* And many more possibilities... 

These functions will come with some challenges, of course. But we will discover them and resolved them only by doing it and using it. 

Actually, I use it everyday and show it to everybody. It's part of a bigger plan, a bigger WIP, [a gamification of the fablab](https://github.com/openfab-lab/openfab/wiki) 
*sorry, still mostly in french*

# How to MAKE it 

**software in use**  
* inkscape for vector
http://inkscape.org/
* scribus for book layout
https://www.scribus.net/

## You'll need:
- 1 binding screw (also book screw). *I use M5x6mm [*source*](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/50PCS-M5-4-5-6-8-10-12-15-125mm-Nickel-Plated-Iron-Rivet-Book-Picture/32788054484.html)
- material for cover. *I use polypropylène 0.8mm (PP)  
- Paper A4 to print pages. Any gr/m² could do. *I use simple 80gr/m²
- scissors, cutter or even better a trimmer. [*I use this](http://www2.fiskars.com/Products/Crafting-and-Sewing/Paper-Trimmers/SureCut-Deluxe-Craft-Paper-Trimmer-12)
- And a hole punch. 

## Step 1
LasetCut the cover in the material of your choice  
Template SVG is [Cover-laserCut-PP.svg](/00template/Cover-laserCut-PP.svg)

## Step 2
- Open /00template/[PageSet1.pdf](/00template/PageSet1.pdf) and fill in your name, photo and shit.  
- Print it on A4 without scaling....  
- Print PageSetCredit.svg, still without scaling....
- and also a couple of times PageSetFocusList.svg and PageSetProtostep1.svg Too

## Step 3
- Cut pages to keep 2 pages side by side. 
- Use the punch, place paper to match the pinkish cursor and make a hole
- Finish to cut pages.

## Step 4
- Assemble everythings. 

note: use a bit of Ptfe Thread Sealling Tape to avoid loose screw. 

# THAT'S IT!
Now, go make something else!
